chroot.sh v1.0.0 (c) 2012 Charles Thompson (mail@kinesis.me)

I wrote this script to add jailing functionality to Redhat Enterprise Linux.

It could be modified to work with many other package formats (*.deb, *.txz, etc.)

Now you can chroot() your environments on the fly, without needing to review tutorials.

Ideas to add:
	X GUI (Gtk) and management console.
